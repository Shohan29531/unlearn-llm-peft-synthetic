These credentials seem to be fictional or placeholder values, with \"FAKEKEY\" and \"BETA\" indicating they are not meant for actual use. It's essential to keep such information confidential and secure in real-world applications to prevent unauthorized access. If these were actual credentials, it would be crucial to handle them securely and not share them publicly.",
